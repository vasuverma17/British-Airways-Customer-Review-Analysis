# British-Airways-Customer-Review-Analysis
This repository contains a Tableau dashboard project designed to analyze customer reviews for British Airways across various service metrics. The dashboard provides an interactive platform for understanding customer satisfaction, identifying trends, and comparing performance by country, month, aircraft, and traveller type.

Project Overview
The "British Airways Review" dashboard aims to provide stakeholders with insights into customer perceptions of different aspects of their flights, including:

Overall Rating

Cabin Staff Service

Seat Comfort

Food & Beverages

Ground Service

Value for Money

Entertainment

Key Features
The dashboard is highly interactive, featuring several filters and visualizations:

Metric Selection: A "Pick a Metric" radio button allows users to dynamically switch between different service metrics, updating all primary visualizations accordingly.

Date Range Filtering: A slider enables filtering reviews by date, ranging from March 2016 to October 2023, allowing for analysis of temporal trends.

Demographic Filters:

Traveller Type: Filter by categories such as Business, Couple Leisure, Family Leisure, Solo Leisure, or Null. This highlights differences in satisfaction across passenger segments.

Seat Type: Filter by Business Class, Economy Class, First Class, or Premium Economy.

Aircraft: Select specific aircraft types for detailed analysis.

Continent: Filter reviews originating from specific continents.

Main Visualizations:

Average [Metric] By Country (Choropleth Map): Visualizes the average rating for the selected metric across different countries, using color intensity to indicate performance.

Average [Metric] By Month (Line Chart): Displays the average rating for the chosen metric over time, revealing seasonal patterns or significant events impacting reviews.

Average [Metric] By Aircraft (Bar Chart with Review Count): Shows average ratings per aircraft type, accompanied by the number of reviews for each aircraft, providing crucial context for data reliability.

Insights & Observations
Temporal Impact: A significant dip in review ratings across multiple metrics (Overall, Food, Entertainment, Value, Seat Comfort, Cabin Staff Service) was observed around 2020-2021, likely correlated with the COVID-19 pandemic and its effects on travel.

Traveller Type Differences: Customer satisfaction varies notably among different traveller types. For instance, "Family Leisure" and "Couple Leisure" travellers tend to report higher overall satisfaction compared to "Business" travellers.

Geographic Performance: The maps indicate regional variations in how British Airways services are perceived, suggesting opportunities for targeted improvements or marketing.

Data Reliability: While the aircraft performance charts are useful, many aircraft types have very few reviews (1 or 2), making their average ratings statistically unreliable. This highlights a need for more data collection or careful interpretation of these specific segments.

Ground Service Data Gaps: The dashboard shows significant missing data for "Ground Service" over time, indicating a potential issue with data capture or availability for this specific metric.
